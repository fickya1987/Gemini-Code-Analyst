    ## <Repository Name> Codebase Analysis Report

    This report provides an in-depth analysis of the <Repo name> <techstack> application codebase, 
    focusing on key aspects such as repository activity, code quality, and adherence to best practices.

    **1. Repository Metadata:**

    * **Commits:** <Info about Commit>
    * **Branches:** <Info About Branches>
    * **Contributors:**  <Info about contributers>

    **2. Code Quality & Best Practices Evaluation:**

    * **Code Quality:** 
        * **Positive:** <detail about code quality>.
        * **Areas for Improvement:**  <areas where the code could be improved> 
    * **Activity Level:**  
        * <Repository activity>
    * **Refactoring Suggestions:**  
        *  <Refactoring Suggestion>
    * **DRY Principle:** 
        *  <Feedback about the code following DRY principle>

    **3. Insights:**
    - Using its understanding of coding best practices, you have to evaluate code quality based on factors like syntax, error frequency, and use of best practices.
    - you should assess the activity level by analyzing commit frequency, number of active branches, and recent pull requests.
    - You will suggest refactoring opportunities by identifying code duplications, complex methods, or inefficient algorithms.
    - Adherence to principles like DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) will be evaluated by detecting repeated code blocks and 
      suggesting optimizations refactoring opportunities, and DRY principle adherence is limited due to the small code sample.

    **4. Recommendations:**

    * **Code Review & Testing:** As the project evolves, prioritize regular code reviews and thorough testing to maintain code quality and identify potential issues early.
    * **Refactoring & Optimization:**  Continuously monitor for code duplication and complexity, implementing refactoring techniques as needed to enhance code maintainability and efficiency.
    * **Collaboration:**  Consider inviting more contributors or seeking feedback from the Rails community to foster diverse perspectives and enhance code quality.

    # Define prompt for Generative AI model

    based on the code you have to perform the following actions if the context is empty then return "Context Empty"1.
    1. Metadata collection on commits, branches, and contributors to understand repository activity.
    2. Answer the following questions \n
        - "What is the code quality of this repository?"
        - "What is the activity level in this repository?"
        - "Are there any suggestions for refactoring in this repository?"
        - "Does this repository follow the DRY principle?"
    3. *Insight Generation:**
        - Using its understanding of coding best practices, the model will evaluate code quality based on factors like syntax, error frequency, and use of best practices.
        - It will assess the activity level by analyzing commit frequency, number of active branches, and recent pull requests.
        - The model will suggest refactoring opportunities by identifying code duplications, complex methods, or inefficient algorithms.
        - Adherence to principles like DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) will be evaluated by detecting repeated code blocks and suggesting optimizations.
    4. Reporting:**
        - Generate comprehensive reports detailing the analysis, which can be used for code review sessions and development strategy planning.
